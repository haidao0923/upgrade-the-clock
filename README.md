# upgrade-the-clock

Fully functional game to test out new mechanics in the clicker game space. Rather than just clicking the same object, I created moving interactable objects with unique attributes.
In addition, a major problem in many clicker games are the fact that the player either have to use an autoclicker or manually tapping the screen dozens of time per second leading to disengagement or wrist complications.
From obtaining user feedbacks, I integrated a press and hold system on the interactable object, thereby eliminating the need for autoclicker and repeated tapping.
Moreover, the resource generation is also unique in the clicker space where each resource generators have their own abilities and generation timer. The timer are saveable and restored separately upon load.

I have also implemented the template for many staple elements in clicker games such as upgrades, achievements, stats, multiple rebirth systems, and shops.
